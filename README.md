# bug-bounty-asssets  
  
I enjoy asset hunting and discovery on targets. My approach is far from perfect, but I am attempting to polish and get much better at the overall practice.  
  
I have create this repo to hold data about public bounty programs in an attempt to help you skip a chunk of discovery and dive straight in to a program of your choice. Now, naturally, you will likely find more than I have here, and that's fine... we probably use different wordlists, different tools and at minimum, have different brains. Feel free to add to them and I can merge :)
